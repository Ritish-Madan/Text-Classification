# Text-Classification
In this text classification model, I have used Python as my programming language and have used the Naive Bayes algorithm. In this, I have classified the documents into different categories accordingly and have used the  UCI 20 Newsgroups dataset.

**Let's get started with the project!
Prequisites:

1. Jupyter notebook or Pycharm (Support with notebooks (.ipynb) extensions).
2. UCI 20 Newsgroups dataset.
3. notebook file in this repository.
4. Motivation!!!

Let's start with the the dataset! The dataset has been downloaded from **http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups.

In order to run the python file, you need this dataset which has been used in this project.

**Description**

The 20 Newsgroups dataset is the dataset consisting of documents from different newsgroups. In this dataset there are 20 different catagories in which we can train our model.
In the dataset.I have achieved the accuracy of approx. 86.5% on the testing data in this classification algorithm popularly known as Naive Bayes Classifiers.

**Some Common errors you might face : **

1. FileNotFound, this is the common error one might face while running the code. In this project the OS library has been used to fetch the data from the local enviroment of the computer. You need to change the directory as per your file location.

2. Another reason might be is that you might not have dataset downloaded, you need to download the dataset from the link given above.
